An application, running locally on a computer, is used to configure the mother board. More specifically, the mother board notifies the client application of the connected sensors. Based on the configuration file of each sensor --hosted online-- the client application allows to configure the update frequency of each sensor and corresponding parameters. 


```
Client App <--> Motherboard  <--> sensor
                          <--> sensor
                          <--> sensor
```
