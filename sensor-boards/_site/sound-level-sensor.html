<p>This section will give an overview of the components of the microphone module.</p>

<h3 id="microphone">Microphone</h3>
<p>A Vesper VM1010 is chosen because it is a low power microphone with a good performance. The microphone consumes 87 µA in active mode (measured). There is also a mode-pin to enable sleep-mode which reduces the current to approximately 5µA. To enable the sleep mode, one has to supply a low level voltage to the mode pin and vice versa. The sensitivity of the microphone equals -38 dBV while the frequency response curve is flat for the audible frequencies.</p>

<h3 id="high-pass-filter">High pass filter</h3>

<p>The passive high pass filter has a -3dB-frequency of 100 Hz and removes the DC-offset of 0.8 V supplied by the microphone. Only 1 alternation of the sound wave is taken into account. This reduces the component cost and increases the stability of the circuit.</p>

<h3 id="amplifier">Amplifier</h3>

<p>An non-inverting amplifier is dimensioned to amplify the signal with 30 dB. A TLV341 is used as operational amplifier because it’s gain bandwidth product of 2.3 MHz is rather high. The quiescent current measures approximately 70 µA per channel.</p>

<h3 id="low-pass-filter">Low pass filter</h3>

<p>A Sallen-Key low pass filter is dimensioned with a -3dB-frequency of 8 kHz to reduce the amplitude of the unwanted ultrasonic sounds. An amplification of 2.73 dB amplifies the signal to an amplitude which is appropriate for the ADC.</p>

<h3 id="analog-to-digital-converter">Analog-to-digital converter</h3>

<p>The 12 bit ADC of the PIC16F18446 samples the analog signal to 16-bit values with a sample frequency of 20 kHz. Because only 1 alternation is used, the ADC will measure the amplitude and not the peak-to-peak value. The PIC16F18446 will sample 1000 values to make sure the max value is approximated as close as possible to the real signal originating from the analog circuit. Whenever a threshold-value is exceeded, an interrupt will inform the motherboard that a dB value is ready.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<p>The microphone module communicates with the motherboard via I2C-commands to set the threshold value or timing interval.</p>
