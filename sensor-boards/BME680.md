BME680 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power consumption are key requirements. The gas sensor within the BME680 can detect a broad range of gases to measure air quality for personal well being. Gases that can be detected by the BME680 include Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) from paints (such as formaldehyde), lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, furnishings, office equipment, glues, adhesives and alcohol.

The sensor module is able to transmit the following four metrics:
1. Temperature in °C
2. Pressure in hPa
3. Air Quality Indication (AQI)
4. Humidity in %


The Air Quality Indication (AQI) is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. 

| AQI      | Air Pollution Level | Air Pollution Category           |           Health Implications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Recommended Precautions                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
